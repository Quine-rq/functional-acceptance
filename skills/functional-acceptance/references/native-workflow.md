# From a user outcome to a reusable native check

Use the project's test framework and commands. This reference supplies a workflow,
not a new test language or a claim of support for every framework.

## Ready check

Use the [acceptance contract](acceptance-contract.md) already established for this
run. Inspect its native entrypoint and how each assertion identifies and observes
the same business object. Resolve missing setup, observation and termination paths
before executing the affected check.

Check only capabilities needed for this path. Read configuration and tool help
first; run a bounded prerequisite probe when necessary and authorized. Missing
browser access, local-listener permission, test identity or dependencies is an
actionable gap, not a reason to replace a requested UI flow with an API assertion.
Name the smallest missing capability and next safe check. Use the host's normal
approval path if the user wants to grant it; Skill text grants no permissions.

## Reuse before generating

Preserve working setup, fixtures, assertions, tracing and cleanup. Add only the
missing outcome check in the project's native conventions and authorized paths.
For UI tests, prefer user-visible locators and waiting assertions. Correlate network
observations with the exact object/request and final response, including redirects.
Inspect collected values before labelling a mismatch; a selector error or response
from another object does not prove a business defect.

Test code is software too. Validate a newly generated check before handing it off:
run it, inspect its actual artifacts, and check that report/observer errors remain
distinct from product failure. A deliberately broken control is useful only when
it is authorized, isolated and clearly labelled; do not mutate a user's application
merely to demonstrate the Skill.

## Failure triage

| Observation | Meaning and next step |
| --- | --- |
| Valid observation of the right object violates a frozen requirement | FAIL; retain actual/expected values and the smallest native reproduction |
| Locator, parsing or reporting fails before obtaining that observation | Test/observation fault; affected outcome UNVERIFIED, retain safe diagnostics |
| Required tool, permission, identity or service unavailable | Environment gap; affected outcome UNVERIFIED, state prerequisite and safe recovery |
| Required observation cannot be obtained | UNVERIFIED; distinguish missing evidence from observing a required artifact was not created |

Preserve all attempts and disclose observer corrections. A later successful
recheck does not erase an earlier qualified business failure. Capture sufficient
startup/error details locally to diagnose failures; avoid credential-bearing
headers, form fills and raw databases. Log redaction is not a guarantee that an
artifact is safe to publish. If evidence delivery fails, stop owned work and hand
off its location/responsibility without claiming a complete report.

## Native handoff and the next change

Leave one reviewed repeat entrypoint with its working directory, prerequisites,
source/fixture identity, expected verdicts, evidence locations and cleanup limits.
Reference secrets by local location, not value. Another executor should not need
the original conversation or this Skill to run the native checks.

On a subsequent change, compare the requested outcome and relevant implementation
with that saved contract. Keep unchanged checks; add or revise checks only where
the requirement or observation actually changed. Record the reason and run fresh
evidence. An old PASS is history. Unknown impact remains a gap rather than a
claim that an automatically selected subset covers everything.

Report whether the pack is a draft, author-replayed, or independently replayed,
and what setup/corrections that required. Count preparation, diagnosis, review
and maintenance when discussing savings—not only the fastest successful run.
